# Karions-Findings
Don't know how to do this, but I'll put my findings here to share

When using Vortex through SteamTinkerLaunch, modding is very easy (tested on Fallout 4, Fallout New Vegas, Tale of Two Wastelands, and Skyrim

Stardew Valley is best played through Proton (any version) and to get it working correctly with modding, download SMAPI manually and run the .bat file through wine. Vortex won't detect natvie games so you need a .exe in the game files. Use "Move deployment (Experimental!)" in the "Mods" tab of the settings. Make sure the staging folder is on the same drive

When installing Endeavour OS make sure to follow the post install guides, as if you're on Nvidia like me the first kernal update will break your install, make sure to install their nvidia-hook package (see here https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/newest-update-broke-install-most-likely-nvidia-drivers/27590)
